# üé• Demo App

We host our demo app on Hugging Face Spaces and use Gradio as our Framework.

You can copy these files to your space to set up Hugging Face Spaces:

- `app.py`: The main app file to run this demo.
- `requirements.txt`: A text file that includes the required packages.
- `README-hf-spaces.md`: Rename this file to `README.md`. It includes the metadata for Hugging Face Spaces.
